                                <p>
                                    A Passionate Data Analyst

                                Once I left high school, I felt as though I knew where my life was going. My plan was to go to trade school and become a licensed aesthetician (skin care professional).
                                I quickly learned just how much that career path was not suited to me as an individual. Instead, I chose to do a massive pivot and pursue a career in STEM.
                                I enrolled in a computer science program and initially began with software engineering, but soon discovered my passion for working with data.
                                I loved it so much, I decided to get a Master's degree too. As someone who is naturally inquisitive, working with data is my cup of tea.
                                I just love seeing how a multitude of different factors can come together to paint a bigger picture.
                                Our world thrives and evolves using the data we collect, and never before has data been collected in such massive quantities at the break-neck pace we see today.
                                The world is in dire need of talented professionals who know how to transform said data into actionable and understandable formats.
                                I hope to cement myself as one of those capable individuals.

                            <p>
                                I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Southern New Hampshire University in June 2023, earning myself a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                                Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science & Analytics from Old Dominion University, with a projected graduation of Fall 2024.

                            <p>
                                Currently, I work for Advantasure as a Data Analyst I. I am responsible for creating and delivering reports to both clients and internal staff. I use SQL often as a part of my daily work flow, and I build Python scripts to enhance reports when needed.
                                Before I secured this full time position, I worked as a Data Analyst Intern for KVLR Capital. During my time there, I built a web scraper to enhance a surgical center data set I found on the CMS website with addresses and webites form Google Maps.

                            <p>
                                During my undergraduate program, I decided I wanted to work as a Data Analyst first, and then move more towards a Data Science role.
                                This decision led me to seek out a Data Science certification. This way, I could familiarize myself with the core concepts of Data Science and
                                push myself in the right direction. In January 2022 I completed the Data Science Professional certification and the associated Capstone Project, which was issued by Coursera and authorized by IBM.
